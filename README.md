# Fernando Pessoa Poem Analyser
Fernando Pessoa is a portuguese poet who wrote for under several different pen names. However, one of the most fascinating aspects about Pessoa's body of work is the fact that each of his pen names had a different personality, writing style and life experience.
That astounding made it so that his pen names werent mere pseudonyms, but whole characters in and of themselves, being called "heteronyms".

 This project aims to develop a machine learning model that receives a Fernando Pessoa poem as input and identifies which heteronym wrote that poem: √Ålvaro de Campos, Alberto Caeiro or Ricardo Reis
